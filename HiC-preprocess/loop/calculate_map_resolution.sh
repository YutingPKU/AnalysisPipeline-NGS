# As described in Rao&Huntley et al., Cell 2014, calculates the map resolution
#
# First creates the 50bp coverage vector. That is, counts the number of 
# contacts for every 50bp bin in the genome (defined as any contact where one
# read mapped within that 50bp bin).
# 
# This vector is then binned into larger and larger increments (i.e. 100bp, 150bp,
# and so on) until the number of bins with >1000 contacts is at least 80% of the 
# total number of bins
#
# Note that the total number of bins depends on the genome size. Change that 
# parameter below if the genome is not hg19
#
# Modified so that binary search is used to more quickly find the map resolution
#
# Usage:
# calculate_map_resolution.sh <merged_nodups file> <50bp coverage file>
#
# The 50bp coverage vector is calculated from the merged_nodups file.
# The 50bp coverage file will be created under the name sent; if it's already been
# created under that name, the script will not recreate it (and indeed will not
# examine the first argument)

# total size of genome, from http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Hg19_Genome_size_statistics
# modify this number if your genome is not hg19
#total=3137161264
